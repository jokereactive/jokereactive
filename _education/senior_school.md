excerpt: Apeejay School, Pitampura is a higherâ€“secondary school located in Pitampura, New Delhi, India. It is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). In the senior secondary phase, we are offered three streams - Science(Non-Medical), Science(Medical) and Commerce. Owing to my keen interest in computers, I chose the non-medical science stream with computer science as my 5th elective. In the board exams in 2012, I finished with an A1 in all subjects(signifying a position in the top octile).
