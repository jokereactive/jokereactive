excerpt: As a part of my Mini Bonus Project in my Image Analysis Course I built a software in C# using emguCV Library to effectively detect players in a football field using Color based object Segmentation. I further wrote an algorithm to detect offside in the game by combining data coming from cameras located at various angles across the field.
