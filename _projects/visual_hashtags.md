excerpt: 
---
We propose a methodology for visual event summarization
by extracting mid-level visual elements from images
associated with social media events on Twitter (#VisualHashtags).
The key research question is <i>"Which elements can visually capture the
essence of a viral event?"</i> hence explain its virality, and summarize
it. Compared to the existing approaches of visual event summarization
on social media data, we aim to discover #VisualHashtags, i.e.,
meaningful patches that can become the visual analog of a regular
text hashtag that Twitter generates. Our algorithm incorporates a
multi-stage filtering process and social popularity based ranking to
discover mid-level visual elements, which overcomes the challenges
faced by direct application of the existing methods.
