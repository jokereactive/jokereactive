We design and implement a system based on a blockchain architecture and face recognition for the conducting indian election. Our solution deals with many of the persistent problems in the process -  

 - *Counting Delays*: Often a delay in announcing poll results. Needless effort spent on exit polls.
 - *Tedious Process*: Aggregating votes from all machines is a tedious process.
 - *Easy Voter Fraud*: Voter Cards are Easily Duplicable.
 - *Lack of Trust*: Who is responsible for miscounting?
 - *Privacy Invasive*: Apprehensive to biometrics. Can be tricked into identity theft.
 - *Voter Proxy*: Voter proxy in exchange for bribes is very common
 - *Scalability*: Difficult to set up centres in remote areas.
 - *Technophobia*: Apprehension to use technology beyond EVMs in voting procedure.
