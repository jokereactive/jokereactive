Research in Artificial Intelligence is breaking technology barriers
every day. New algorithms and high performance computing
are making things possible which we could only have
imagined earlier. People in AI community have diverse set of opinions regarding the
pros and cons of AI mimicking human behavior. Instead of
worrying about AI advancements, we propose a novel idea
of cognitive agents, including both human and machines, living
together in a complex adaptive ecosystem, collaborating
on human computation for producing essential social goods
while promoting sustenance, survival and evolution of the
agentsâ€™ life cycle. We highlight several research challenges
and technology barriers in achieving this goal. We propose a
governance mechanism around this ecosystem to ensure ethical
behaviors of all cognitive agents. Along with a novel set
of use-cases of <i>Cogniculture</i>, we discuss the road map ahead
for this journey.
