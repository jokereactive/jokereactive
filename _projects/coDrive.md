excerpt:
---
Often offline storage runs out on mobile devices, and the user then needs to store data either on cloud,
or on external media. We propose a solution, wherein the user needn’t be concerned
about the security of their data in the cloud, by simply storing it on a dedicated
space on one of his trusted peers, at the luxury of a network.
We have implemented an application that allows multiple users to share some space
on each of their drives (offline storages). This is achieved by initially setting up a
fixed amount of space on each user’s local drive, required for the purpose of the
application. Once a user issues a request to his/her list of “friends”, it can be accepted
for storing the user’s data.
