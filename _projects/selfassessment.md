Robots operating in human environments must be care-ful when executing their manipulation skills. This requires robots toreason about the repercussions of their actions on other objects inthe environment. Humans can visually inspect their surroundings andgain a physical intuition about how likely it is that a particular objectcan be safely manipulated (i.e., cause no disruption in the rest of thescene). Existing work has shown the ability of deep convolutionalneural networks to learn intuitive physics over images generated insimulation and determine the stability of the scene. In this paper, weextend these physics intuition models to the task of assessing safe object extraction by conditioning the visual images on specific objectsin the scene during training. We further explore methods for aggre-gating multiple views of a scene to increase the modelâ€™s accuracy forscenes that contain either a large number of objects or unstructuredobject arrangements. Our results in a simulated object extraction taskshow that with our proposed method, physics intuition models can beused to accurately inform a robot of which objects can be safely ex-tracted and from which direction to extract them.
