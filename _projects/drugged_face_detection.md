excerpt: We propose a system which can use the data of face images from such sources and identify faces possibly altered by prolonged
narcotic drug usage. Experiments were conducted majorly on before-after drug mug-shot images made public by Multinomah Sheriff County Office. We use three different types of feature extraction techniques: HoG, Local Binary Patterns and Color Histogram, over which we apply a Support Vector Machine with different kernels to classify the face images. Access to our database is available on request.
