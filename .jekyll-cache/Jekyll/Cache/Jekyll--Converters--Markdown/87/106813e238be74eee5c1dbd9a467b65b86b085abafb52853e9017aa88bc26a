I"Î<p>Robots operating in human environments need to perform a variety of dexterous manipulation tasks on object arrangements that have complex physical support relationships, e.g. procuring utensils from a large pile of dishes, grabbing a bottle from a stuffed fridge, or fetching a book from a loaded shelf. The cost of a misjudged extraction in these situations can be very high (e.g., other objects falling) and therefore robots must be careful not to disturb other objects when executing manipulation skills. This requires robots to reason about the effect of their manipulation choices by accounting for the support relationships among objects in the scene. Humans do this in part by visually assessing the scene and using physics intuition to infer how likely it is that a particular object can be safely moved. Inspired by this human capability, we explore how robots can emulate similar vision-based physics intuition using deep learning based data-driven models.</p>
