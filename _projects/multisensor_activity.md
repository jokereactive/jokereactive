excerpt: As of today the state-of-the-art architecture for Human activity detection is found in two different domains. One is where wearable sensors like accelerometers, gyrometers mounted on smartphones and smartwatches are used and other where egocentric cameras are used. The use of egocentric cameras on human activity detection has just cropped up. We here perform data fusion between these two domains in an attempt to improve the performance of the existing architecture. Access to our database is available on request.
