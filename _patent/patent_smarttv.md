#The main novelty of our system is a decentralized agent based architecture for the complete TV show recommendation and watching experience in both a multi-user and single-user setting. Each agent is allowed to have itâ€™s own unique method to compute recommendations for it's assigned user. We detail an ecosystem and define it's rules, where these agents can autonomously collaborate and generate these recommendations.
