 - I hold the position of <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-sarahuja">Research Software Engineer</a> at <a href="http://research.ibm.com/">IBM Research, New Delhi</a>, 
working in the <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=7806">Collaborative Cognition</a> (earlier known as the Analytics and Optimization) 
group at the Delhi office. 
 - My job role includes building 
the machine learning component of the cognitive platform <a href="https://www.ibm.com/talent-management/hr-solutions/recruiting-software">IBM Watson Recruitment</a> under Watson Talent Management. 
 - I also explore the idea of decentralized collective intelligence in the recruitment domain through cognitive agent modeling of stakeholders to accomodate their diverse definitions of a successful candidate. 
 - I work on developing this framework for these cognitive software agents to engage in a sequential game for <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group_subpage.php?id=7807">Collaborative Decision Making</a>, and eventually reach a consensus on an adoptable list of candidates.
