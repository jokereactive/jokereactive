excerpt: 
---
In this project I focus on animating a 2D mesh character and driving its actions through kinect. 
The system implemented in Visual Studio interact with our kinect device and fetch the skeleton data captured in the form of coordinates. We then create our 2D mesh in QT and use these coordinates to mimic the skeleton. The project follows a bone based skeleton model to construct our 2D mesh character. The project can seamlessly by ported to work for 3D characters as well.
