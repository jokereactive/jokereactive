excerpt: The project was given to our Institute by the Wildlife Institute of India. The ultimate goal was to identify tigers based on their stripe pattern and the first step towards this was to segment the tiger out from the image. My initial role was to perform a literature surveys on graph-based image segmentation methods and later I was given the task of implementing the state-of-the-art graphcuts algorithm on tiger images to perform binary segmentation. The distance-metric used in the algorithm was a kernel based semi-supervised distance metric obtained by optimization on the Riemann manifold. Towards the end of the project we were able to obtain reasonable results on the tiger images which were taken in the night under artificial lighting.
