Solutions providing hiring analytics involve mapping company
provided job descriptions to a standard job framework, thereby
requiring computation of a similarity score between two jobs. Most systems
doing so apply document similarity computation methods to all
pairs of provided job descriptions. This approach can be computationally
expensive and adversely impacted by the quality of the job descriptions
which often include information not relevant to the job or candidate qualifications.
We propose a method to narrow down pairs of job descriptions
to be compared by comparing job titles first. The observation that each
job title can be decomposed into three components, domain, function
and attribute, forms the basis of our method. Our proposal focuses on
training the machine learning models to identify these three components
of any given job title. Next we do a semantic match between the three
identified components, and use those match scores to create a composite
similarity score between any two pair of job titles. The elegance of this
solution lies in the fact that job titles are the most concise definition
of the job and the resulting matches can easily be verified by human
experts. Our results show that the approach provides extremely reliable
results.
