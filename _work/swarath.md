Worked as a member of IIIT-Delhiâ€™s core team participating in the "Rise the Spark" National Driverless Challenge by Mahindra. Our team was a mix of faculty and students from IIIT-Delhi, who together had expertise in vision, robotics, embedded systems, sensing, and communications. This project is now funded and housed at the Infosys Center for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi with the ultimate goal to launch autonomous shuttles that provide anytime last mile connectivity in Indian cities. I joined the team during it's inception phase and during my tenure, led a team of 2 to design the Test Bench and Perception Module in ROS/C++. I also delivered workshops on ROS, Git and C++ to ~40 interns during the summer of 2015.
