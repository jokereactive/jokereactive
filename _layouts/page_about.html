<p><strong>I'm an incoming Software Research Engineer at <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/">IBM Research</a>; GSoC student developer at <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>; 
and Summer Research Associate at <a href="http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/">PreCog, IIIT-Delhi</a>,.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Prior to this I was the Head of Product Development at <a href="http://meriawaazapp.com">Meri Awaaz</a>; 
a member of the core team at <a href="https://plus.google.com/100998403142875299317/posts">Swarath</a>(Autonomous Car Team @IIIT-Delhi) and 
a student researcher in the Computer Vision and Machine Learning Group at IIIT-Delhi.
</p>
  I recently completed my undergrad from <a href="http://www.iiitd.ac.in">IIIT-Delhi</a> earning a B.Tech(Honors) degree in Computer Science; 
 </p>
 <p>
	 As an aspiring researcher, my area of interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence. Human perception is remarkable at many levels if one thinks about the complexity of data it processes every second. One of the most important senses in this perception system is vision. My interest lies in developing algorithms and systems that find structure in this visual input and enable autonomous systems to become more ubiquitous and better integrated into everyday life.
	 During my undergrad I was advised by <a href="https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~anands/index.html">Dr. Saket Anand</a> and <a href="https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~chetan/">Dr. Chetan Arora</a> on my thesis "<i>Applications of Modern SLAM systems for Visual Positioning</i>".
</p>
<p>
	 While I have a keen interest in research, as an engineer I am a strong believer in the application of science as technology to benefit the community as a whole by tackling everyday problems. At Meri Awaaz I am a part of a team that aims to tackle one such critical issue in India - <i>Bad Governance</i>. Our aim is to bridge the gap between the people and the people in power through mobile governance. We are currently gaining momentum in Delhi and if you are a resident, you can download the application on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meriawaaz.mygap&hl=en">google playstore</a> to explore more.<br>
	 On a separate occassion I have been advised by <a href="https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~skkaul/">Dr. Sanjit Kaul</a> on an independent project "<i>Distress Detection</i>" - a mobile application for women safety that applies machine learning on speech signals for scream detection. This project won the first prize at <a href="rs.iiitd.ac.in">Research Showcase'15</a> held at IIIT-Delhi for best poster presentation and demo, (Elevator Pitch Event).
	 Dr. Sanjit alongside Dr. Saket is also the leading faculty at Swarath where I have been working since May, 2015. 
</p>
<p>
	 At Swarath I was part of a diverse team of faculty members, PhD scholars, graduate and undergraduate students working towards the <a href="http://www.sparktherise.com/program-detail/driverless-car-challenge">"Spark the Rise" Driverless Car Challenge</a> by Mahindra. I worked as project lead on designing the perception module and testing suite. Besides working on the system, I also delivered workshop sessions on Git, ROS and C++ to ~40 interns at Swarath. 
</p>
<p>
	 I feel lucky to have met the right mentors and teachers at the right moment and have tremendous respect for this profession. I too am a strong believer of sharing what I know and helping others reach their maximum potential. During my stay at IIIT-Delhi, I have been given a <a href="{{site.url}}/teaching/">number of opportunities</a> to take up the role of a mentor and teaching assistant. I also served as the coordinator of <a href="http://foobar.iiitd.edu.in/">Foobar</a> - Programming Club IIIT-Delhi where we aim to improve the overall programming culture at IIIT-D.
</p>
<p>
	 My interests are not strictly academic; I am also an active graphic designer and the co-founder of <a href="http://ink.iiitd.edu.in/about/">Ink.</a> - Design Club at IIIT-Delhi. A glimpse of my work can be seen on <a href="https://www.behance.net/sarthakahuja">my behance page</a>. I have designed graphics and creatives for my institute several times, being the founding member of it's media panel. I also worked professionally as department lead in the Communications and Information Management branch at <a href="http://www.aiesec.in/">AIESEC</a> in Delhi University during 2013-14. 
</p>
<p>
	 I enjoy working in teams and leading them towards specific goals; I have taken up administrative and leadership roles on <a href="{{site.url}}/cocurricular/">several occassions</a>. These have been truly memorable experiences and have significantly contributed towards my personal and professional growth.
</p>
<p>
	 I am always open to meeting people and discussing ideas and opportunities. Find my contact details <a href="{{site.url}}/contact/">here</a>.
