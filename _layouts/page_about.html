<p><strong>I currently hold the position of Research Software Engineer at <a
href="http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-sarahuja">IBM Research</a>, working in the <a
href="http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view _group.php?id=7806">Collaborative Cognition</a> group.</strong> </p> <p>My current 
work includes building the cognitive platform <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/talent/recruitment/">IBM Watson
Recruitment (IWR)</a> under the Watson Talent Management agenda. Besides developing the platform, I
work on extending <a href="http:// researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view_group_subpage.php?id=7807">Collaborative Decision
Making</a> to the recruitment system. This allows for multiple stakeholders to reach a consensus on which candidates to hire by engaging in a sequential gameplay of knowledge and incentive exchange.
</p> <p>I also work on the <a href="http
://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view_group_subpage.php?id=7807">Cogniculture</a> project, where my team and I aim to
develop next-gen social machines to acquire necessary socio-cultural adapability skills to sustain (e.g. essential
supplies self-sufficiency), survive (e.g. protect from environmental threats), and evolve (e.g. co-create far superior
social welfare) in a civilization.</p> 

<p>Someday I want to build truly adaptive intelligent systems which are capable of not just co-existing but <b>co-evolving alongside humans</b>.<br>
A crucial aspect of this co-evolution is for these systems to possess the ability to empathize - <b>understand intent and learn behaviour</b>.<br>
I am facinated by the <a href="https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/five-levels-of-capability-of-deep-learning-ai-4ac1d4a9f2be">Theory of Mind</a> which provides an interesting model to create this empathetic system.</p> 

<p> Prior to IBM, I graduated with an undergrad degree in
Computer Science from <a href="http://www.iiitd.ac.in">IIIT-Delhi</a> working on projects around machine learning and
computer vision; Head of Product Development(Web) at <a href="http://meriawaazapp.com">Meri Awaaz</a>; a member of the
core team at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/swarathatiiitd/">Swarath</a> (Autonomous Car Team @IIIT-Delhi) where I
worked on the perception module;  Research Associate at <a href="http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/">Precog</a> (Social Media
Analytics Group @IIIT-Delhi) where I worked on visual summarization of social media datasets. </p>

<p>I am always open to meeting people and discussing ideas and opportunities. Find my contact details <a
