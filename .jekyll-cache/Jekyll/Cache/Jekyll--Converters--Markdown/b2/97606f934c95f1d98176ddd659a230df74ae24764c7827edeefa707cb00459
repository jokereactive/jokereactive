I"c<p>Methods, systems and computer program products for generating virtual reality (VR)-based interactive audience simulations are provided herein. A computer-implemented method includes determining one or more situational and location characteristics for a given performance by a user, generating a VR-based simulated audience for the given performance based at least in part on the determined situational and location characteristics, presenting the VR-based simulated audience to a user during the given performance utilizing a VR headset, utilizing one or more sensors to measure one or more aspects of the given performance before the VR-based simulated audience, and generating real-time feedback adjusting the VR-based simulated audience presented to the user utilizing the VR headset based at least in part on the measured aspects of the given performance.</p>
