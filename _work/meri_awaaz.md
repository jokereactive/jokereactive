Worked as Head of Product Development at Meri Awaaz, India's first platform that connects citizens with their Netas and government officials for open, accessible and accountable governance. It is mobile-first realtime public engagement tool that brings transparency to the work being done in one's constituency. The platform also aided government departments and candidates to understand the current issues in an area and better organize tasks among their teams. Through our application, Netas found a medium to connect with their local electorate and showcase their work, thus incentivizing Development and Issue based politics. I was one of the founding members and developed it's web and cloud component. We ran a successful pilot with the Janakpuri constituency alongside the Aam Aadmi Party reaching a user count of 5000. As our work lead to the resolution of numerous citizen issues ranging from sanitation and electricty to law and order, our platform received appreciation and coverage on multiple media platforms.
