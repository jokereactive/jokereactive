Meri Awaaz is India's first platform that connects citizens with their netas and government officials for <i>Open, Accessible and Accountable Governance</i>. 
I developed the web dashboard which was used by candidates/netas in two constituencies of Delhi to interact with the respective citizens and address their issues. The dashboard allowed elected officials to view citizen issues, delegate work to their team, run campaigns, post updates about the progress made and compare their efficiency with other politicians within the constituency.
