I"D<p>A method, system and computer program product for assessing similarity between two job description documents. Job description documents consist of sentences framed in a particular manner, where the sentences are represented as a set of actions, an object corresponding to each action and a set of attributes corresponding to the object. The two job description documents are parsed to generate a first and a second set of an action-object-attribute triplet representation, where the first set of the action-object-attribute triplet representation is associated with the first job description document and the second set of the action-object-attribute triplet representation is associated with the second job description document. A similarity score between the first and second sets of action-object-attribute triplet representations is then calculated by hierarchically matching the first and second sets of action-object-attribute triplet representations across the job description documents. In this manner, similar job positions/job descriptions may be more accurately identified.</p>
