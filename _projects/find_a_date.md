excerpt: While designing one of the project assignments for CSE201-Advanced Programming, to make things more interesting and fun I added this as a side project. The end goal was to use your facebook account to look for potential dates by finding people of the opposite sex in the same age group and institute. One was expected to also plot the last known location of the potential dates on map. Though the end objective was later modified to something more subtle and appropriate by the Instructor, I find this project cool enough to be mentioned here!
