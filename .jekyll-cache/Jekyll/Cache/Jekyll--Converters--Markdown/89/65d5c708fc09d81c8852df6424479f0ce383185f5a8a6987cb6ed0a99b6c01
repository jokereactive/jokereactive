I"K<p>We investigate an unobtrusive and 24×7 human distress detection and signaling system, Always Alert, that requires the smartphone, and not its human owner, to be on alert. The system leverages the microphone sensor, at least one of which is available on every phone, and assumes the availability of a data network. We propose a novel two-stage supervised learning framework, using support vector machines (SVMs), that executes on a user’s smartphone and monitors natural vocal expressions of fear — screaming and crying in our study — when a human being is in harm’s way.</p>
