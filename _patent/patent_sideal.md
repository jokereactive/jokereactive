Here we disclose a public goods games (PGG) based system to define and refine relative weights of various attributes defining the profile. 
The system consists of a SIdeal agent corresponding to each recruiter with a preferred weightage for various attributes. 
These agents are engaged in a sequential gameplay where they modify and update their preferences to eventually converge on a consensus.
