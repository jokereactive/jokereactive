 I worked as a member of IIIT-Delhiâ€™s core team participating in the <a href="http://www.sparktherise.com/what-you-get/">"Rise the Spark" National Driverless Challenge by Mahindra</a> under <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/anands">Dr. Saket Anand</a>. This project is now funded and housed at the <a href="http://cai.iiitd.ac.in/research.php">Infosys Center for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi</a> with the ultimate goal to launch autonomous shuttles that provide anytime last mile connectivity in Indian cities. 

 - Designed and developed the ROS infrastructure (design patterns, test suite, topics, messages) for the perception system of a drive-by-wire autonomous E-rickshaw.
 - Implemented multiple monocular SLAM algorithms such as LSD-SLAM and ORB-SLAM and rigorously tested their effectiveness on a collected dataset of Indian roads.
 - Delivered workshops on ROS, Git and C++ to ~40 junior interns and mentored them in developing perception algorithms for pedestrian and lane detection - leading to our team's qualification for the Mahindra Driverless Car Challenge.
