Currently a member of IIIT-Delhiâ€™s core team participating in the "Rise the Spark" Driverless Challenge by Mahindra. We are a mix of faculty and students from IIIT-Delhi, who together have expertise in vision, robotics, embedded systems, sensing, and communications. While we pursue research in our areas of expertise, we make a conscious effort to put our findings to work in the practical world. Our ultimate goal is to launch autonomous shuttles that provide anytime last mile connectivity in Indian cities. I led a team of 2 and designed the Test Bench and Perception Module in ROS/C++. Delivered workshop on ROS, Git and C++ to ~40 interns during the summer of 2015.
