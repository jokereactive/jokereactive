I worked as a summer Research Associate at IIIT-Delhi's social media analytics research lab, <a href="http://precog.iiitd.edu.in/index.php">PreCog</a> under <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/pk">Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru</a> and <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/subramanyam">Dr. A.V. Subramnyam</a>. 

- Developed an unsupervised discriminative clustering method that used iteratively trained SVMs for patch-based visual summarization of social media events.
- Reduced the search space for user queries (by 99%) all the while maintaining a high coverage and interpretability that was verified through a user-study.
- Presented the resulting paper at ACM Multimedia 2017 in Mountain View, USA. Checkout this work <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/projects/visual_hashtags/">here</a>. 
- Simultaneously worked on a development project, adding multi-platform analytics support to <a href="http://aasma.precog.iiitd.edu.in/">Project-O</a>, a production level social media analytics platform.
