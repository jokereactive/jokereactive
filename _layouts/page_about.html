<p><strong>I am a Research Masters student at the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University</a>.</strong> I work with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~astein/">Prof. Aaron Steinfeld</a> and <a href="http://hennyadmoni.com/">Prof. Henny Admoni</a> as a member of the <a href="http://harp.ri.cmu.edu/">Human and Robot Partners (HARP) Lab</a> and the Transportation, Bots and Disabiliities (TBD) Lab. </p>

<p>Someday I want to build truly adaptive socially intelligent systems which are capable of not just co-existing but <b>co-evolving alongside us humans</b>. While my technical research background is in the domains of machine learning, computer vision, and multi-agent systems; my philosophical research interests revolve around the mysteries of human cognition and evolution. I am interested in 
(a) exploring existing and ongoing research on human cognition and behaviour, thereby gaining <b>insight into how we perceive, think about and interact with our environment (socially and physically)</b>, and (b) developing methods for robotics systems that can take advantage of these insights to <b>enhance robot learning and interaction capabilities in human spaces</b>.
</p>
I see Robotics and AI as evolutionary catalysts, capable of latently solving fundamental problems beyond automation - even breaking social-constructs that dictate the role an individual plays in society. These ground-breaking offerings rest on the precondition that robots are welcomed into the our personal and public spaces as <i>trust-worthy</i> and <i>productive</i> companions. I am fascinated by the fact that both these requirements go beyond conventional robotics, that works really well in isolatation, but is far from functioning autonomously in the real world amongst us humans.
<br>
<br>
My current research is focused on - 
<ul>
    <li><b>Learning Physics Intuition Models</b> - <i>How can robots reason about their interactions with the physical world and operate safely when in human spaces?</i></li>
    <li><b>Learning Human Intent Models</b> - <i>How can robots capture a humanâ€™s behaviour and expectations during the learning process?</i></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
<b>TL;DR: I want to make <i>socially</i> intelligent and <i>physically</i> aware robots because that's the only way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzlsvFN_5HI"> they are coming into our homes.</a></b> 
</p>
<p>When I am not working, I am open to engaging in collaborative aimless wondering about these topics. Find my contact details <a
