excerpt: 
---
Explored  modern  SLAM  algorithms  and  built  systems  for  visual  positioning  and  navigation  inwearable  cameras  and  vehicle  dashboard  camera. 
Built  a  navigation  system  to  carry  out  robust  visual  positioning  for  a  car  by  using  a  generated odometry on encountering an erratic GPS signal; Built the apparatus for the dashcam using a pointgrey camera and an intel NUC running an implementation of the LSD-SLAM algorithm.
