I am a Masters (by Research) student and a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/sarthak-ahuja/">Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I work in the Human and Robot Partners (HARP) Lab and the Transportation, Bots, and Disabilities (TBD) Lab. I am advised by <a href="https://hennyadmoni.com/">Prof. Henny Admoni</a> and <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/aaron-steinfeld/">Prof. Aaron Steinfeld</a>, on robot self-assessment, specifically robot perception and reasoning for predicting the effects of robot interaction with the physical world.

 - Proposed object-conditioned multi-view CNNs to predict, a priori, the resulting stability of partially occluded cluttered scenes and guide a robot in safely extracting objects.
 - Developed a data-simulation pipeline using MuJoCo to generate synthetic data for training the model and used domain randomization to transfer it to real-world scenes.
 - Delivered a real-time pipeline for object detection using Mask-RCNN and accomplished object-correspondence across multiple-views using deep feature matching and completed its visual assessment using the proposed model.
 - Successfully demonstrated an overall reduction in the manipulation failure rate around careful object selection by 15% on our collected dataset (under review at IROS 2020). Read the abstract for this work <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/projects/selfassessment/">here</a>. Manuscript is available on request.  
 - Member of the <a href="https://successmuri.org/">SUCCESS MURI</a>. My work is supported by the Office of Naval Research (N00014-18-1-2503).
