 - I held the position of <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-sarahuja">Research Software Engineer</a> at <a href="http://research.ibm.com/">IBM Research</a>, 
working in the <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=7806">Collaborative Cognition</a> (earlier Analytics and Optimization) 
group at the Delhi office under <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-gyana.parija">Dr. Gyana Parija</a>. 
 - My job role included designing and building 
the machine learning component for the cognitive platform <a href="https://www.ibm.com/talent-management/hr-solutions/recruiting-software">IBM Watson Recruitment</a>. 
 - I also explored the idea of decentralized collective intelligence in the recruitment domain through cognitive agent modeling of stakeholders to accomodate their diverse definitions of a successful candidate. 
 - I worked on developing this framework for cognitive software agents to engage in a sequential game for <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group_subpage.php?id=7807">Collaborative Decision Making</a>, and eventually reach a consensus on an adoptable list of candidates through rank aggregation. 
 - In this line of research my team and I maintained a strong focus on creating collaborative autonomous agents that exhibited 2 specific behaviours: (1) conducting privacy-preserved knowledge sharing and (2) modelling other participating agents intent and behaviours into the decision making.
