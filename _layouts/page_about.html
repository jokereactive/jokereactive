<p><strong>I am a Research Masters student in the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.</strong> I work with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~astein/">Prof. Aaron Steinfeld</a> and <a href="http://hennyadmoni.com/">Prof. Henny Admoni</a> as a member of the <a href="http://harp.ri.cmu.edu/">Human and Robot Partners (HARP) Lab</a>. </p>

<p>Someday I want to build truly adaptive socially intelligent systems which are capable of not just co-existing but <b>co-evolving alongside us humans</b>. While my technical research background is scattered in the domains of statistical machine learning, geometric computer vision, collaborative decision making in multi-agent systems, and NLP for knowledge representation; my philosophical research interests revolve around the mysteries of human cognition and evolution. I am interested in <ol><li> exploring existing and ongoing research on human cognition and behaviour, thereby gaining <b>insight into how we perceive, think about and interact with our social environment</b>, and</li> <li> developing methods for robotics systems that can take advantage of these insights to <b>enhance their learning and interaction capabilities during collaborative tasks alongside humans</b>.</li></ol><br>
<br>
I see Robotics and AI as evolutionary catalysts, capable of latently solving fundamental problems beyond automation - even breaking social-constructs that dictate the role an individual plays in society. These ground-breaking offerings rest on the precondition that robots are welcomed into the our personal and public spaces as <i>trust-worthy</i> and <i>productive</i> companions. I am fascinated by the fact that both these requirements go beyond conventional robotics, that works really well in isolatation, but is far from functioning autonomously in the real world amongst us.
<br><br>
<b>TL;DR: I want to make socially intelligent robots because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gpoZzwcKY">isolated intelligence clearly doesn't cut it</a></b>. 
</p>
<p>When I am not working, I am open to engaging in collaborative aimless wondering about these topics and depending on the time and person, anything but. Find my contact details <a
