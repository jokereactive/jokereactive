  <strong>I'm currently an undergrad student in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.iiitd.ac.in">IIIT-Delhi</a>; Head of Product Development(Web) at <a href="http://meriawaazapp.com">Meri Awaaz</a>; and a member of the core team at <a href="https://plus.google.com/100998403142875299317/posts">Swarath</a>(Autonomous Car Team @IIIT-Delhi). </strong>

 <p>
	 As an aspiring researcher, my area of interest lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence. Human perception is remarkable at many levels if one thinks about the complexity of data it processes every second. One of the most important senses in this perception system is vision. My interest lies in developing algorithms and systems that find structure in this visual input that would enable autonomous systems to become more ubiquitous and better integrated into everyday life.
	 <br>Currently I am adviced by <a href="https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~anands/index.html">Dr. Saket Anand</a> and <a href="https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~chetan/">Dr. Chetan Arora</a> on my undergraduate thesis "<i>SLAM in egocentric videos</i>".
</p>
<p>
	 While I have a keen interest in research, as an engineer I am a strong believer in the application of science as technology to benefit the community as a whole by tackling everyday problems. At Meri Awaaz I am a part of a team that aims to tackle one such critical issue in India - <i>Bad Governance</i>. Our aim is to bridge the gap between the people and the people in power through mobile governance. We are currently gaining momentum in Delhi and if you are a resident, you can download the application on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meriawaaz.mygap&hl=en">google playstore</a> to explore more.<br>
	 On a separate occassion I have been adviced by <a href="http://www.iiitd.ac.in">Dr. Sanjit Kaul</a> on an independent project "<i>Distress Detection</i>" - a mobile application for women safety that applies machine learning on speech signals for scream detection. This project won the first prize in the <a href="rs.iiitd.ac.in">Research Showcase'15</a> held at IIIT-Delhi for best poster presentation and demo.
	 Dr Sanjit Kaul alongside Dr. Saket is also the leading faculty at Swarath where I have been working since May, 2015.

<p>
	 At Swarath we are a young team comprising of faculty members, PhD scholars, graduate and undergraduate students working towards the <a href="http://www.sparktherise.com/program-detail/driverless-car-challenge">Spark the Rise Driverless Car Challenge</a>. I work as a project lead on designing the perception module and testing suite.

	 My interests are not strictly academic; I am also a passionate graphic designer and the co-founder of <a href="http://ink.iiitd.edu.in/about/">Ink.</a> - Design Club at IIIT-Delhi. A glimpse of my work can be seen under the name <a href="https://www.behance.net/sarthakahuja">FrozenInk</a>.</p>
