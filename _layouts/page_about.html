<p><strong>I am a Research Masters student in the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">Robotics Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.</strong> I work with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~astein/">Prof. Aaron Steinfeld</a> and <a href="http://hennyadmoni.com/">Prof. Henny Admoni</a> as a member of the <a href="http://harp.ri.cmu.edu/">Human and Robot Partners (HARP) Lab</a>. </p>

<p>Someday I want to build truly adaptive socially intelligent systems which are capable of not just co-existing but <b>co-evolving alongside us humans</b>. While my technical research background has been scattered in statistical machine learning, geometric computer vision, collaborative decision making in multi-agent systems, and NLP for knowledge representation; my philosophical research interests revolve around the mysteries of human cognition and evolution. I am interested in (a) exploring and evaluating research on human cognition and behaviour that gives an <b>insight into how we perceive, think about and interact with our social environment</b>, and (b) developing methods for robotics systems that can take advantage of these insights to <b>enhance their learning and interaction capabilities during collaborative tasks alongside humans</b>. <br>
<br>
I see Robotics and AI as evolutionary catalysts, capable of inherently solving fundamental problems beyond automations - even breaking social-constructs that dictate the role an individual plays in society. These ground-breaking offerings rest on the precondition that robots are welcomed into the our personal and public spaces as trust-worthy and productive companions. I am fascinated by the fact that both these requirements of being trust-worthy and productive go beyond conventional robotics, that works really well in isolatation, but is far from functioning autonomously in the real world because it don't account for us!
<br><br>
<b>TL;DR: I want to make socially intelligent robots because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5gpoZzwcKY">isolated intelligence clearly doesn't cut it</a></b>. 
</p>
<p>When I am not working, I am open to meeting people for engaging in collaborative aimless wondering about these topics and depending on the time and person, anything but. Find my contact details <a
