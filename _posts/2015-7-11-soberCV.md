Finally I found some free time to setup my own website. It was very surprising that I couldn't find a good enough resume template to meet my most simple needs - *minimal in design, maximal in functionality*. It was the same old story- *the good ones were paid and the free ones were'nt good enough*. Well this did inspire me to make one for myself and I am glad I did. I hope it comes in handy to undergraduate engineers and researchers for showcasing their work without much effort. This site is based on [Jekyll]() with base templates coming from [poole]() and [hyde](). I call it **soberCV**. 
It is made keeping in mind my favorite design principle - **KISS: Keep it Simple, Stupid**. Some features that distinguish it form the conventional static pages are:

- 3 Different Collection Layouts ![soberCV]({{ site.url }}/public/favicon.png)
- Well organized internal structure
- Minimal need of dealing with html and css 
- SAAS makes it easy to customize
- Jekyll support on github - free hosting
- Based on Hyde - responsive

If you find soberCV impressive and meeting your needs, I am soon going to opensource is for anyone to fork from the link given in the bottom left corner.

PS: Some parts of my site are still under construction, will be updated soon.
