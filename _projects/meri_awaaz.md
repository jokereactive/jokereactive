excerpt: Meri Awaaz is India's first platform that connects citizens with their netas and government officials for Open, Accessible and Accountable Governance. It is mobile-first real time public engagement tool that makes catching up with the work being done in your area as easy as following up your timeline. I develop and maintain the Dashboard which is being used by Candidates/Netas in Delhi to interact with citizens of their constituency and address their issues.
