 - Fettle is a highly intuitive food recommendation cum fitness tracking android application. 
 - Besides just allowing a user to order food from nearby restaurants or track their physical activities, the application closed the loop by integrating both the experiences and enabled a user to stay in control of his/her health. 
 - Based on a person’s physique/targeted physique on the food ordering menu, the application would sort the food items based on a user calorie requirements for the day. In addition to just sorting, it would also translate the food items in fitness terms such as - “eating this burger would mean a 20min walk or a 10min run or 30mins of lifting weights”. 
 - The system also tracked the fitness activity of the user and allowed for this food ranking to get relaxed if the person had been working out well. 
 - In our food recommendations not only did we incorporate the calorie count but also the constituent protein, fibre, etc counts to allow the user to make an informed choice. The ranking list also incorporate meeting these constituent targets for the day - “high fat lunch would recommend a low fat dinner”. 
 - The system was built to be completely dynamic, customisable and self-sufficient. As in the user got to choose the physical activities he or she would like to be tracked on and the recommendations would update after every meal and work out. 
 - The tracking for the physical activity happened from within the application itself while the meals were to be recorded by the user through a highly assistive search where we listed frequent items. 
 - For our demo we had incorporated within our menu’s data scraped from zomato and foodpanda of all local restaurants, we also added items of regular meals people have at home and created our complete dataset on which the application ran. We allowed for users to add additional food items as well which they consumed. 
 - The menu’s into the three important meals of the day - breakfast, lunch and dinner, for each a recommendation was given based on what the user had previously during the day alongside how much he/she had worked out. 
 - Alongside all the functionality, the application was highly intuitive and minimal in design, completely abstracting the user from the underlying complexity and not overloading him/her with these functions. 
 - A major highlight was the landing screen would in a very minimal way convey both the fitness status and calorie consumed for the person alongside a recommendation for his/her next meal and workout.
