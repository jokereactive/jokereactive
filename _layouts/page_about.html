Recruitment (IWR)</a> under Watson Talent Management. Besides developing the platform, I also 
work on extending <a href="http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view_group_subpage.php?id=7807">Collaborative Decision
Making</a> to the recruitment system. This embodiment of decentralized artificial intelligence allows for multiple stakeholders to share their private knowledge, beliefs, intent and desires over a sequential gameplay and collectively reach a consensus on which candidates to hire.

<p>Someday I want to build truly adaptive intelligent systems which are capable of not just co-existing but <b>co-evolving alongside humans</b>. My research interests include human cognition and it's implementation in intelligent systems, enabling them to <b>better understand human intent and behaviour</b>.<br>
