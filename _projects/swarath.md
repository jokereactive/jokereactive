As a member of IIIT-Delhiâ€™s core team participating in <a href="http://www.sparktherise.com/what-you-get/">Mahindra's National Driver Less Challenge</a>, I designed Swarath's test suite and perception module in ROS/C++. The test suite architecture defined a paradigm that allowed the development team to create unit test datasets for each added feature. The perception module followed the strategy design pattern and externalized control to the main dashboard, enabling switching between algorithms and sensors for core perception tasks such as path planning, object detection, 3D mapping and lane detection.
