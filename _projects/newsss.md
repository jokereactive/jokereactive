Social search is a behaviour of retrieving and searching on a social searching engine that mainly searches
user-generated content such as news, videos and images related search queries on social media. 
In this project we create our own Social Search Engine implementing Adapted PageRank Algorithm based on the paper - <i>Information retrieval in folksonomies: Search and ranking, A Hotho, R JÃ¤schke, G Stumme</i>
