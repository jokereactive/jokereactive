<p><strong>Robotics Graduate Student at Carnegie Mellon University</strong></p>

<p>Someday I want to build truly adaptive intelligent systems which are capable of not just co-existing but <b>co-evolving alongside us humans</b>. While my technical research background has been scattered in statistical machine learning methods, geometric computer vision and image understanding, planning and decision making in multi-agent networks, natural language processing for information extraction; my philosophical research interests continue to revolve around the mysteries of human cognition and how their application in intelligent systems can enable them to <b>better collaborate (understand, communicate, act) with us</b> and eventually become entities that are welcomed as our everyday companions.<br>

<p>Like most people I am thoroughly entertained by science-fiction literature and drama around Robotics/AI even though it might seem to be dark, bleak and apocalyptic. Even though a part of me would love to see this happen for the excitement and storyline such a situation would provide; when saner thoughts prevail my motivation behind pursuing the field is to enhance human capability. I believe there are two kinds of things we are not supposed to be doing (or at least not supposed to be doing alone) - <br>
<ul>
<li> difficult things, which we are not physically/mentally capable of doing. </li>
<li> mundane things, which consume our time that could have been better spent on pursuits like creativity, ideation, relationships, politics and social good. </li>
</ul>
I see Robotics/AI as evolutionary catalysts capable of inherently solving fundamental problems beyond these automations - particularly breaking social-constructs that dictate the role an individual plays in society. 
<br><br>
<b>TL;DR: I want a robot to make a sandwich for me</b>.

<p>When I am not working, I am quite open to meeting people for discussing ideas and opportunities or even engaging in collaborative aimless wondering about anything but. Find my contact details <a
