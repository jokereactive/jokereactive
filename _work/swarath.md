 - I worked as a member of IIIT-Delhiâ€™s core team participating in the <a href="http://www.sparktherise.com/what-you-get/">"Rise the Spark" National Driverless Challenge by Mahindra</a> under <a href="https://www.iiitd.ac.in/anands">Dr. Saket Anand</a>. 
 - This project is now funded and housed at the <a href="http://cai.iiitd.ac.in/research.php">Infosys Center for Artificial Intelligence at IIIT-Delhi</a> with the ultimate goal to launch autonomous shuttles that provide anytime last mile connectivity in Indian cities. 
 - I joined the team during it's inception phase and during my tenure, led a team of 2 to design the Test Bench and Perception Module in ROS/C++. 
 - I concurrently delivered workshops on ROS, Git and C++ to ~40 interns during the summer of 2015.
