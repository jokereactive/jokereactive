<p><strong>I am a Masters (by Research) student at the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University</a>.</strong> I work with <a href="http://hennyadmoni.com/">Prof. Henny Admoni</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~astein/">Prof. Aaron Steinfeld</a> on enabling robots to - 
<ul>
    <li><b>Model Physical Interactions</b> - How can robots reason about their interactions with the physical world and operate safely when in human spaces? [<a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/projects/selfassessment/">1</a>]</li>
    <li><b>Model Social Interactions</b> - How can robots model human behaviour and expectations during the learning process? [<a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/projects/intentmanipulation/">2</a>, <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/projects/cc/">3</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I have 3+ years of professional experience in <b>applied machine learning</b> and <b>computer vision</b> in both robotics and non-robotics contexts and I am incredibly fascinated by how data-driven automation is bringing about technological disruption across the world. <b>I aspire to be at the forefront of this revolution.</b>
<\p>
<p>
I have a demonstrated history of designing, developing, and deploying large-scale machine learning systems for real-world applications. My <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/res_projects/"><b>past work</b></a> has involved leveraging existing research literature to propose novel solutions for numerous domain-specific challenges often leading to top-conference <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/publication/"><b>publications</b></a>, <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/eng_projects/"><b>open-sourced code</b></a>, and <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/patent/"><b>patents</b></a>.
    </p><p>
    <b>I am currently looking for full-time opportunities</b> in the field of perception, robot autonomy, and machine learning in the USA. An ideal opportunity for me would be working at a growth-oriented company or an R&D lab. Based on <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/work/">my past experiences</a>, I love working with talented individuals in closely-knit collaborative teams that are passionate about solving challenging problems in the aforementioned areas.

<p>Someday I want to build truly adaptive socially intelligent systems which are capable of not just co-existing but <b>co-evolving alongside us humans</b>. While my technical research background is in the domains of machine learning, computer vision, and multi-agent systems; my philosophical research interests revolve around the mysteries of human cognition and evolution. I am interested in 
(a) exploring existing and ongoing research on human cognition and behaviour, thereby gaining an <b>insight into how humans perceive, think about and interact with with other social agents and the physical environment </b>, and (b) developing methods for robotics systems that can take advantage of these insights to <b>enhance robot learning and interaction capabilities in human spaces</b>.
</p>
I see Robotics and AI as evolutionary catalysts capable of latently solving fundamental problems beyond automation - even breaking social-constructs that dictate the role an individual plays in society. These ground-breaking offerings rest on the precondition that robots are welcomed into our personal and public spaces as <i>trust-worthy</i> and <i>capable</i> companions. I am fascinated by the fact that both these requirements go beyond conventional robotics research that work really well in isolatation, but is far from functioning autonomously in the actual real world scenarios.
<br>
<br>
My current research is focused on enabling robots to - 
<ul>
    <li><b>Model Physical Interactions</b> - <i>How can robots reason about their interactions with the physical world and operate safely when in human spaces?</i> [<a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/projects/selfassessment/">1</a>]</li>
    <li><b>Model Social Interactions</b> - <i>How can robots model human behaviour and expectations during the learning process?</i> [<a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/projects/intentmanipulation/">2</a>, <a href="https://sarthakahuja.org/projects/cc/">3</a>]</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
<b>TL;DR: I work on making <i>socially</i> intelligent and <i>physically</i> aware robots! </b>
