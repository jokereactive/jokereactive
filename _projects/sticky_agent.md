Prototype of a group messaging service for customer complaint redressal. We created a mobile application to file complaints and reconnect the customer with the same agent on his/her issue follow-up to remove the requirement of the customer explaining the problem again(Hence, the word "sticky"). For each complaint, we created a chatroom which remained active until the customer was satisfied with the solution. The complaint orchestrator could add the required people and delegate or follow up on the progress in real time. Our team finished in the top 10 among 25 teams.
