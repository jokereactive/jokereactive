<p><strong>Robotics Graduate Student at Carnegie Mellon University</strong></p>

<p>Prior to grad school, I was a Research Engineer at <a
href="http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-sarahuja">IBM Research</a>, working in the <a
href="http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=7806">Collaborative Cognition</a> group. I started as a member of the core team building the cognitive platform <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/talent/recruitment/">IBM Watson
Recruitment (IWR)</a> and later transitioned into extending <a href="http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view_group_subpage.php?id=7807">Collaborative Decision
Making</a> to the cognitive recruitment ecosystem. In simple words, this can be thought of as an embodiment of decentralized artificial intelligence that allowed for multiple stakeholders/intelligent autonomous agents to share their private knowledge, beliefs, and intentions over a sequential privacy-preserving gameplay and collectively reach a consensus on which candidates to hire.

<p>Someday I want to build truly adaptive intelligent systems which are capable of not just co-existing but <b>co-evolving alongside us humans</b>. While my technical research background has been in statistical machine learning methods, geometric computer vision and image understanding, planning and decision making in multi-agent networks, natural language processing for data science; my philosophical research interests continue to revolve around the mysteries of human cognition and how it's implementation in intelligent systems can enabling them to <b>better interact with us</b> and eventually become welcomed as our everyday companions.<br>

<p>I am always open to meeting people and discussing ideas and opportunities. Find my contact details <a
